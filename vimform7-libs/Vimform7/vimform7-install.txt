VIMFORM7 1.0 - Vim environment to edit and compile Inform7 projects.

The vimform7-install.sh script installs the vimform7 toolset, inform7 
compilers, inform7 interpreters, inform7 help documents, and default 
extensions.  This script should be run as a normal user.  The script will
ask for sudo permission as needed during the installation.  The bulk of
the installation copies data to ~/.vimform7/.  Only several scripts are
copied into ~/.local/bin in order to ensure that they are visible
system wide.  Sudo operations are required to install vimform7 
dependencies such as vim, lynx, make, and uuidgen.  To remove vimform7 
from your system simply run vimform7-uninstall.sh and all installed 
files will be deleted.

Dependencies:

    vim         Editor (dnf install vim / apt-get install vim)
    lynx        Web Viewer (dnf install lynx / apt-get install lynx)
    make        Build Tool (dnf install make / apt-get install make)
    uuidgen     UUID Tool (dnf install util-linux / apt-get install
