VIMFORM7 1.0 - Vim environment to edit and compile Inform7 projects.

The vimform7-open-prj.sh script allows users to open an existing Inform7
project within the VIM editor and also prepares the editor for working
with Inform7 projects.  It loads up the most recently edited file in an
Inform7 project, Inform7 syntax help, and a interactive fiction player if
desired that uses the latest build of the project.

    vim		Editor (dnf install vim / apt-get install vim)
